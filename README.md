## See [this](https://github.com/1ahmadbassam/pcem_cache/blob/dev/README.md) for a description of what this is and [this](https://86box.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dev/buildguide.html) for building.

_Unlike the PCem fork, you can configure caching from the settings menu just like you can for the dynamic recompiler._

Note: this won't be merged to 86box anymore. I still maintain this anyway. I personally do not prefer to use the caching feature as this severly impacts the performance of the emulated CPU, but in some cases this is okay and perfectly useful (such as using Windows XP on a P300, for example).
Note: I also build 86box optimized, which I recommend you to do as it also helps immensely with perfomance.
