## Unlike the PCem fork, you can configure caching from the settings menu just like you can for the dynamic recompiler.

Note: this won't be merged to 86box anymore. I'll try my best to keep it synced with master. I personally don't use it as much because of crap PS/2 emulation in 86box which just 'dies' suddenly. Could be related to the caching thing (I don't really have the capability to investigate).
